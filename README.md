# Image-creation-with-Buildah-using-Dockerfile

Buildah is an open source, Linux-based tool that can build Docker and Kubernetes-compatible images.


## Description:-

Buildah is a command-line tool for creating Open Container Initiatives (OCI) or traditional Docker images, without a full container runtime or daemon installed. Here I have created an image using Dockerfile with buildah on Ubuntu.


## Pre-requisites:-

The buildah package is available in the official repositories for Ubuntu 20.10 and newer.


## Installation steps:-


```html
sudo apt-get -y update
. /etc/os-release
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/x${ID^}_${VERSION_ID}/ /' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list"
wget -nv https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable/x${ID^}_${VERSION_ID}/Release.key -O Release.key
sudo apt-key add - < Release.key
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get -qq -y install buildah
```
  
#### To check version:-
  
```html
buildah -v
buildah version 1.21.3 (image-spec 1.0.1-dev, runtime-spec 1.0.2-dev)
```

## Building with a Dockerfile

buildah can build a container image by referring the same Dockerfile that docker build refers to. 

Let's consider this simple Dockerfile for example.  

 
**NOTE:** I have created a custom website with files under "/website" folder.


 ```html
 ~# cat Dockerfile

 FROM httpd:2.4-alpine

 COPY ./website/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/

 CMD ["httpd-foreground"]
 ```

Once we save this file as Dockerfile in our local directory, we can use the bud command to build the image:


 ```html
 ~# buildah bud -t htmlapp
```

#### Output:-
